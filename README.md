## Preface

An intelligent tool for recording user keystrokes while remain hidden in the background with the ability of storing the keystrokes locally on the computer as specified by the person who would execute it and also have the capability of uploading the local file to a remote server through FTP (File Transfer Protocol). The tool is heavily built on the edge of Windows API, i.e. heavily dependent on Windows.h header file and using important functions In the tool like GetAsyncKeyState and GetKeyState etc. The tool also has the ability to execute in the stealth mode in the background and still recording the keystrokes even checking in when the caps lock is on or when the shift is down which helps it determine when to write a specific alphabet, number, symbol or a punctuation. And finally, to shut it down, a combination of a special keys needs to pressed and it will then automatically clean the grid off and shut down.
